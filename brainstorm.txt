+ 3d projection filter
+ for each axis:
	sort in descending order of that coordinate and iterate from max down:
		if next point <= in all other axes than the last point, remove it
		if they're equal in primary iteration axis, 
			compare all equal elements to the element before that equal range.
			when you have multiple goods in the prev round, see if it increases the stat from the minimum of them.
			Silver_Skree: The next point needs to have AN axis value that's better than the combined minimums of all the last good points

. Rings and Earrings are slot-flagged for only the left
	. minimum item id goes in left slot to avoid duplicates of just left-right swapped sets
. also weapons if dual wielding

/ handle restricted slots

. add some small value for any stat given?
	general item level?
+ whether more or less of a stat counts as good (delay -)
	dusk gear
	consider naked slot ?
	see purpose.want_negative={[STAT_NAME] = true}

+ filter out of gear list any stat you care about that's negative

● Currently, we're feeding a gear_list that has been filtered down to currently-equippable items into the permutator.
	Do we want to instead permute ALL gear with a subtractive blend of jobs as we go, and build a larger but more general-purpose cache on disk?

● ^ OR, iterate over the set of all purposes, and check whether each piece of gear (or each set?) gives ANY stats that are beneficial to a given purpose, and cache that it's relevant to that purpose
