+ for each axis:
	sort in descending order of that coordinate and iterate from max down:
		if next point <= in all other axes than the last point, remove it
		if they're equal in primary iteration axis, 
			compare all equal elements to the element before that equal range.
			when you have multiple goods in the prev round, see if it increases the stat from the minimum of them.
			Silver_Skree: The next point needs to have AN axis value that's better than the combined minimums of all the last good points
